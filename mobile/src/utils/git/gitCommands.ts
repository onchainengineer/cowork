/**
 * Git command builders for code review
 */

/**
 * Build git diff command based on diffBase and includeUncommitted flag
 * Shared logic between numstat (file tree) and diff (hunks) commands
 *
 * Git diff semantics:
 * - `git diff A...HEAD` (three-dot): Shows commits on current branch since branching from A
 *   → Uses merge-base(A, HEAD) as comparison point, so changes to A after branching don't appear
 * - `git diff $(git merge-base A HEAD)`: Shows all changes from branch point to working directory
 *   → Includes both committed changes on the branch AND uncommitted working directory changes
 *   → Single unified diff (no duplicate hunks from concatenation)
 * - `git diff HEAD`: Shows only uncommitted changes (working directory vs HEAD)
 * - `git diff --staged`: Shows only staged changes (index vs HEAD)
 *
 * @param diffBase - Base reference ("main", "HEAD", "--staged")
 * @param includeUncommitted - Include uncommitted working directory changes
 * @param pathFilter - Optional path filter (e.g., ' -- "src/foo.ts"')
 * @param command - "diff" (unified) or "numstat" (file stats)

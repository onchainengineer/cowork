 * MutexMap - Generic mutex utility for serializing operations per key

 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```typescript
 * const fileLocks = new MutexMap<string>();
 *
 * // Serialize writes to the same file
 * await fileLocks.withLock("file.txt", async () => {
 *   await fs.writeFile("file.txt", data);
 * });

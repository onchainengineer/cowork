# EAS builds run from the monorepo root.
# The mobile app imports shared code from ../src/ via @/ aliases,
# so we must include both mobile/ and src/ directories.
# All third-party deps the shared code needs are in mobile/package.json.

# Exclude everything first

# Include mobile app
!mobile
!mobile/**

# Include shared source code (imported via @/ alias)

!src/**

# Exclude unnecessary stuff from included dirs
